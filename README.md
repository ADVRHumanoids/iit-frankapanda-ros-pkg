# iit-frankapanda-ros-pkg

HHCM repo for Franka Panda models. 
- [franka_description](https://github.com/ADVRHumanoids/iit-frankapanda-ros-pkg/tree/master/franka_description) is for ROS use **without XBot**. Check that folder for more info on its readme
- *frankapanda_xxx* folders are the usual HHCM folder structure for robot use with XBot / Cartesio. But it has to be tested, working is not guaranteed at the moment
